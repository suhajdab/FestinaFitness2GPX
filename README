# Festina Fitness Data to GPX Converter

This script converts fitness data downloaded from the Festina app into GPX format, which can be used with various fitness and mapping applications.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- NPM (usually comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download and extract the ZIP archive.
2.  Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Usage

1.  Export your fitness data from the Festina app in JSON format.
2.  Save the exported JSON file to a location on your computer.
3.  Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the following command to convert the JSON data to GPX format:

bash

```bash
npm run convert -- /path/to/your/fitness-data.json
```

Replace `/path/to/your/fitness-data.json` with the actual path to the exported JSON file.

5.  The script will create a new GPX file in the same directory as the input JSON file, with the same filename but with a `.gpx` extension. For example, if the input file is named `fitness-data.json`, the output file will be named `fitness-data.gpx`.
6.  You can now import the generated GPX file into your preferred fitness or mapping application.

## Notes

- The script combines location data with the last known heart rate value for each location data point.
- The GPX file generated by this script is compatible with various fitness and mapping applications, such as Strava, Garmin Connect, and Google Earth.
- This script is provided as-is, and there is no guarantee it will work with all fitness data exported from the Festina app. Please make sure to double-check the generated GPX file before using it with any other applications.
- The lion's share of the work has done by GPT-4 :)
